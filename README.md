# ClickyGame

My hero clicky game is a game in which to score the player needs to click on a different character every time. If the player manages to click all the character without failing then he scores a win, but if he fails he scores a lost. The game keeps going even if the player scores a win or a lost, it only resets when the page is refreshed.
